#' rrnni: Calculate a distance and a path in RNNI space
#'
#' RNNI stands for Ranked Nearest Neighbour Interchange and is an extension of the classical
#' NNI space (space of trees created by the NNI moves) to ranked trees, where internal nodes
#' are ordered according to their heights (usually assumed to be times).
#' Since ranked trees are variants of time trees, they keep the biologically relevant information
#' about the timing of events, such as splits.
#' Note that we assume ultrametric trees, i.e. all leaves have the same time, and unique order
#' of internal nodes, which means that two non-leaf nodes cannot have the same time.
#'
#' The RNNI distance takes the tree topology into account, as standard NNI does, but also penalizes
#' changes in the order of internal nodes, i.e. changes in the order of times of evolutionary events.
